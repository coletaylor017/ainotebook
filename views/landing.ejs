                Whenever we write, we censor ourselves. Whether we are composing an email, typing a paper, or even writing a journal entry, we tend to edit our work as we produce it. This can eliminate important thoughts and discourage creativity. In contrast, freewriting is a free-flowing style of writing where thoughts flow stright from your brain onto the page. When done properly, freewriting produces original ideas, helps to process emotions, and clears the mind.

                Writing Blocks is a tool intended to help you reap the benefits of freewriting. There are other sites that accomplish the same purpose, but they either cost money, look gross, or don't have powerful features. With Writing Blocks, you can find daily inspiration, maintain a daily freewriting habit, and analyze your work, all in a beautifully simple, distraction-free interface.
