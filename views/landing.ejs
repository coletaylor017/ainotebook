                        <p class="landing-p">A 2007 UCLA study focused on the reaction of the amygdala, the brain’s alarm system, when participants were shown pictures of angry or fearful faces. Some were asked to describe each face’s emotion as it appeared, and others simply observed. Their brain activity was studied using fMRI. <strong>Participants who described what they were observing showed a decreased fear response.</strong></p>

                            In 1991, an experiment was conducted involving 41 people who were recently laid off. They were divided into three groups- one was not given special instructions; one was instructed to write about their day; and a third was asked to write about their deepest thoughts and emotions surrounding the job loss and their job search. The third group showed mich higher job placement rates compared to the other two after eight months.

                            Another experiment had participants engage in 15-minute writing sessions for three days. Those who wrote about emotional or traumatic experiences reported that although the writing may have been distressing, they considered the experience very valuable and would do it again. These participants also exhibited increases in mental and physical health.
