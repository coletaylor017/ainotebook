        <p>Writing Blocks is built for freewriting (the practice of spilling all your thoughts onto the page as quickly as possible). There are other sites that accomplish the same purpose, but they either cost money (750words, Writely, Ommwriter) or don't have the features I want (WriteHoney). With Writing Blocks, you can find daily inspiration, write, and analyze your writing for free- all in a beautiful, minimalisst interface.
